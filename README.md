## Purpuse

Python2.7 has been deprecated as the community is strongly pushing for the use of python3.
Therefore, python2.7 can't be installed using `homebrew` anymore. However, lots of code still depends on it.
So, this is an alternative one-line command installer.

## Usage
Copy and paste the following line to the terminal.

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alkeldi/python2.7fix/master/python2.7fix.sh | bash`
